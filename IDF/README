""" This folder /home/yseut/characterize_extremes/colab_IDF_dani/ aims 
to compute IDF curves on one gridpoint using the POT (Peak over threshold) method """

*extract_rain_one_point.py* 
	1. opens interactive map: click to choose the gridpoint
	2. extract 10 minute rain data on this point for all monthly file from 2011 to 2020
	3. concatenate all months and save in *rainfall_data_2011_2020_{x_ind}x_{y_ind}y.pkl*
	4. *rainfall_data_2011_2020_835x_520y.pkl* is xarray of 10 min rain 2011-2020 in one point of genoa gulf

*plot_rain_timeseries.py* (verification)
	1. read pickle
	2. plot map with selected point
	3. plot time serie of 10min rain in the selected point
